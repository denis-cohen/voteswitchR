The `voteswitchR` package is an open-source R package that
offers a suite of functions for managing and analyzing vote
switching data.
It offers a comprehensive software implement of the
conceptual framework and the various extensions presented in @Cohen2023.

`voteswitchR` consists of the following functions:

**For data processing:**

1. `build_data_file`: Harmonize, impute, map, rake, and aggregate vote switching data
1. `recode_switches`: Recode aggregate switching patterns
1. `calculate_meas_error`: Calculate measurement error in vote switching survey data

**For data analysis:**

1. `run_mavcl`: Run the MAVCL model
1. `calculate_pred_error`: Calculate the MAEs and RMSEs of MAVCL Predictions
1. `compute_qoi`: Compute MAVCL quantities of interest

**Package-specific data:**

1. `mappings`: Mappings of vote choices from surveys to ParlGov and MARPOR IDs
1. `codebook`: Documentations of mappings
1. `data_guide`: Versions, download links, and access details for survey data

On top of these, generalized functions for the visualization of quantities of
interest generated via `compute_qoi()` are currently in development.

This vignette illustrates the functionality and the use
of `voteswitchR`.

## Data processing

### Building the data infrastructure: `voteswitchR::build_data_file()`

The primary tool for data processing is the `voteswitchR::build_data_file()`
function. The function launches a ShinyApp that provides a graphical user
interface (GUI) that guides users through three sequential steps to
initialize the HIMRA (harmonization, imputation, mapping, raking, aggregation)
routine.

The first step is **concept and context selection**.
The screenshot below the corresponding slide of the
Shiny GUI.
Here, users can select both the concepts (variables) and contexts (elections) they wish
to include in the data processing routine. The concepts "vote choice at $t$"
and "vote choice at $t-1$" are selected by default, as these are strictly required
for the study of vote switching.

The selection of additional variables can serve three distinct purposes.
First, information on variables such as party identification, left-right
self-placement, or like/dislike-scores of parties can decisively improve the
performance of the imputation of vote choice/vote switching data.
Secondly, users may wish to use any categorical variables to study
subgroup-specific vote switching. For instance, by including information on
respondents' gender, users can request gender-specific voter transition
matrices for each electoral context.
Thirdly, users may wish to include any additional variables and forego
the aggregation step to use the micro-level data, enriched with contextual
information from our mapping file, to conduct classical analyses
of individual or contextual determinants of vote choice or vote switching.

```{r build1, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Shiny GUI: Step 1 (concept and context selection)'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/build_data_file1.png")
```

The second step is **data procurement**.
Our data infrastructure is based on decades of election studies from various
countries. Needless to say, the right to distribute the data lies with the
respective owners and data providers.
Therefore, the original election studies cannot be distributed as a part of the
`voteswitchR` package. Instead, they must be retrieved from the data providers.
To facilitate this step as much as possible, the second screen of the Shiny GUI,
shown below, guides users through this process.
First, users can specify a path at which a folder structure will be initialized
(by clicking on **Create initial folder structure**).
This structure will contain a separate sub-directory for each selected electoral
context selected in the previous step.

Users can then consult the data table shown in the screenshot below to
learn about the logistics of data procurement. For each selected electoral context,
the table specifies the corresponding data set (`source`) and data set version
(`version_dataset`), as well as the link where the data can be downloaded or
requested (`download_link`) as well as the prerequisites for data access
(`data_access`).
For instance, data for the 2013 Austrian General Election comes from
The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, Module 4 (CSES 4, Version 2018),
which can be downloaded from [cses.org](https://cses.org/) after
accepting the data provider's terms of use.

```{r build2, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Shiny GUI: Step 2 (data procurement)'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/build_data_file2.png")
```

```{r access, eval=TRUE}
access <- table(voteswitchR::data_guide$data_access) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::rename(`Data Access` = Var1,
                `Frequency` = Freq)
```

Nearly 60% of all electoral contexts included in `voteswitchR`'s data processing
routine come from comparative projects like CSES 2-5
[@CSES2; @CSES3; @CSES4; @CSES5] and The European Voter Project [@EVP_1973-1998].
Thus, users can get access to comparative vote switching data from over 130
electoral contexts by obtaining only these five data files.
The rest of the electoral contexts come from national election studies, some of
which stipulate more restrictive data access conditions. The table below
gives an overview. Most of the data can be simply downloaded after
accepting the terms of use, sometimes with prior registration at the
data provider's data portal. For `r access$Frequency[3]` electoral contexts
from the European Voter Project, the data must be requested from
[GESIS](https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA3911).
For a few remaining electoral contexts, specific research proposals (and,
in some cases, signed use agreements) are required in order to access the data.
`voteswitchR::data_guide` gives a complete overview of all election studies and
data access logistics.

```{r access-print, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
access %>%
  huxtable::as_huxtable(.) %>%
  huxtable::set_width(., 1) %>%
  huxtable::set_all_padding(4) %>%
  huxtable::set_font_size(9) %>%
  huxtable::set_background_color(., evens, everywhere, "grey95") %>%
  huxtable::set_align(col = 2:ncol(.), value = "right") %>%
  huxtable::set_bold(row = 1, col = everywhere) %>% 
  huxtable::set_bottom_border(row = 1, col = everywhere) %>%
  huxtable::set_caption(value = "An overview of access logistics across all post-election surveys.")
```

Once users have obtained all election studies for the electoral contexts
they have selected, they must store each data file in the correct subfolder
(given by `folder_name`).
Once data procurement is complete, users must simply click **Find files**
in the GUI. `voteswitchR` will automatically scan the subfolders for
data files in Stata (`.dta`), R (`.RData`) and SPSS (`.sav`, `.por`) formats
and display the file name in the GUI under `file_name_options`.
If a single file is found, the field will turn green. If multiple files are
found (e.g., because a subfolder contains data files in both `.dta` and `.sav`
formats), the field will turn orange; users can then select one of the files
from a drop-down menu. If no data file is found, the field will turn red,
indicating that users should check if they correctly stored the data in the
correct subfolder. Once all fields have turned green, users can advance to
the next slide of the GUI.

The third and final step is the **specification of function arguments**.
A screenshot of the corresponding GUI is shown below.
Here, users can specify input arguments to the HIMRA routine and request
their desired outputs.
The first HIMRA step, *harmonization*, is performed by default. Users can
specify whether they want to impute missing values or not. If the `impute` box
is ticked, users can enter the request number of imputations (`n_imp`) and
supply a seed (`seed`) to ensure that the routine is reproducible.
Similarly, users can specify if they want to `map` the vote switching data to
external party and election IDs and whether they want to `rake` and `aggregate`
the corresponding counts from the election-specific voter transition matrices.
Note that mapping is a prerequisite for both raking and aggregation.

```{r build3, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Shiny GUI: Step 3 (function arguments)'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/build_data_file3.png")
```

The remaining arguments allow users to specify the output to be returned:

- `return_data`: Return the harmonized unimputed survey data (with an extra column `raked_weights` if `rake == TRUE`).
- `return_data_imp`: Return a list of `n_imp` harmonized imputed survey data (with an extra column `raked_weights` if `rake == TRUE`).
- `return_agg_data`: Return aggregate counts for each cell of each election-specific voter transition matrix, based on the unimputed survey data. Raked weights will be used if `rake == TRUE`.
- `return_agg_data_imp`: Return a list of `n_imp` aggregate counts for each cell of each election-specific voter transition matrix, based on the imputed survey data. Raked weights will be used if `rake == TRUE`.

Once users click **Execute**, the data processing routine will start. For the
current sample of electoral contexts,
the routine will take roughly 15 minutes to complete without imputation
and several hours with imputation. The routine returns an object
called `data_file`, which contains all the requested output. By default,
this object will be stored in the current R environment.

### Data preparation for subgroup-specific voter transition matrices {-}

`voteswitchR:::aggregate_switches()` is an internal package function that is
called in the final step of the HIMRA routine to generate the
aggregate counts for each cell of each election-specific voter transition matrix
that users can request via `return_agg_data` or `return_agg_data_imp`.

When conducting subgroup-specific analyses, users are advised
to apply this function to the harmonized and mapped (and, optionally,
imputed and raked) micro-level data returned by selecting `return_data`/
`return_data_imp` instead of running it as part of the HIMRA routine.
Applying the aggregation post-hoc allows users to flexibly retrieve 
(raked) cell counts for any available subgroup.

The code below illustrates how users can retrieve gender-specific aggregate
counts for each cell of election-specific voter transition matrices, using
multiple imputation and raked weights, by applying this function to the
harmonized and imputed micro-level data stored in `data_file$data_imp`: 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
for (m in seq_along(data_file$raked_switches_imp)) {
  data_file$raked_switches_imp[[m]] <-
    voteswitchR:::aggregate_switches(
      data_file$data_imp[[m]],
      weights_var = "raked_weights",
      subgroup = "male"
    )
}
```

Here, the loop iteratively runs the function across the `n_imp` imputations.
`weights_var` requests the use of raked weights. The argument
`subgroup` specifies a column in `data_file$data_imp[[m]]` that defines the
subgroup.

### Generalized transition matrices {-}

The aggregation step outlined above produces "raw" voter transition matrices:
Each cell count represents switches between specific parties. 
An example is given in the table below, which shows the raked
cell counts for the 2010 UK General Election.
The column `weights` records the raked counts for each cell.
As we can see, this raw transition matrix is of dimensions $5 \times 5$ and thus
has $25$ cells.

```{r raw-switches, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '') 
data_file$raked_switches_imp[[1]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(elec_id == "GB-2010-05") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    switch_from = ifelse(switch_from %in% c(1, 5, 6, 7, 8), 98L, switch_from),
    switch_to = ifelse(switch_to %in% c(1, 5, 6, 7, 8), 98L, switch_to)
  ) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(elec_id, switch_from, switch_to) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(
    weights = sum(weights, na.rm = T),
    n = unique(n)
  ) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(
    voteswitchR::mappings %>%
      dplyr::select(
        elec_id, 
        stack,
        party,
        partyabbrev
      ) %>%
      dplyr::rename(
        cmp_from = party,
        name_from = partyabbrev
      ),
    by = c("elec_id", "switch_from" = "stack")
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    name_from = dplyr::case_when(
      switch_from == 98 ~ "others",
      switch_from == 99 ~ "non-voters",
      TRUE ~ name_from
    )
  ) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(
    voteswitchR::mappings %>%
      dplyr::select(
        elec_id, 
        stack,
        party,
        partyabbrev
      ) %>%
      dplyr::rename(
        cmp_to = party,
        name_to = partyabbrev
      ),
    by = c("elec_id", "switch_to" = "stack")
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    name_to = dplyr::case_when(
      switch_to == 98 ~ "others",
      switch_to == 99 ~ "non-voters",
      TRUE ~ name_to
    )
  ) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(
    -starts_with("switch"),
    -starts_with("cmp")
  ) %>%
  dplyr::relocate(name_from, name_to, .after = "elec_id") %>%
  huxtable::as_huxtable(.) %>%
  huxtable::set_width(., 0.8) %>%
  huxtable::set_all_padding(4) %>%
  huxtable::set_font_size(9) %>%
  huxtable::set_background_color(., evens, everywhere, "grey95") %>%
  huxtable::set_align(col = 2:ncol(.), value = "right") %>%#
  huxtable::set_bold(row = 1, col = everywhere) %>%
  huxtable::set_bottom_border(row = 1, col = everywhere) %>%
  huxtable::set_tabular_environment(., "longtable") %>%
  huxtable::set_caption("Raw (party-specific) raked vote switching counts, 2010 UK General Election.") %>%
  huxtable::set_caption_pos(value = "bottomcenter") %>%
  huxtable::set_label("raw-switches")
```

Users can use `voteswitchR::recode_switches()` to convert such "raw" voter
transition matrices into generalized transition matrices by
recoding the switches to a meaningful scheme for comparative inquiries.
For instance, we could re-express the party-specific switches as switches between
governing parties, opposition parties, and non-voters, thus reducing the
context-specific $5 \times 5$ transition matrix to a generalized $3 \times 3$
matrix that is universally applicable to all electoral contexts.
In the context of the 2010 UK General Election, the incumbent
government was a single-party majority government led by Labour, whereas
the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, and others constituted the opposition.
As a result, we can re-express the voter transition matrix as follows:

```{r recoded-switches-2, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
data_file$raked_switches_imp[[1]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(elec_id == "GB-2010-05") %>%
  dplyr::left_join(
    voteswitchR::mappings %>%
      dplyr::mutate(
        gov = case_when(
          outgoing_cabinet_party_lag == 1 ~ "government",
          TRUE ~ "opposition"
        )
      ) %>%
      dplyr::select(
        elec_id, 
        stack,
        gov
      ) %>%
      dplyr::rename(
        gov_from = gov
      ),
    by = c("elec_id", "switch_from" = "stack")
  ) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(
    voteswitchR::mappings %>%
      dplyr::mutate(
        gov = case_when(
          outgoing_cabinet_party_lag == 1 ~ "government",
          TRUE ~ "opposition"
        )
      ) %>%
      dplyr::select(
        elec_id, 
        stack,
        gov
      ) %>%
      dplyr::rename(
        gov_to = gov
      ),
    by = c("elec_id", "switch_to" = "stack")
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    gov_to = dplyr::case_when(
      switch_to == 98 ~ "opposition",
      switch_to == 99 ~ "non-voters",
      TRUE ~ gov_to
    )
  ) %>%
    dplyr::mutate(
    gov_from = dplyr::case_when(
      switch_from == 98 ~ "opposition",
      switch_from == 99 ~ "non-voters",
      TRUE ~ gov_from
    )
  ) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(elec_id, gov_from, gov_to) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(
    weights = sum(weights, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = unique(n)
  ) %>%
  huxtable::as_huxtable(.) %>%
  huxtable::set_width(., 0.8) %>%
  huxtable::set_all_padding(4) %>%
  huxtable::set_font_size(9) %>%
  huxtable::set_background_color(., evens, everywhere, "grey95") %>%
  huxtable::set_align(col = 2:ncol(.), value = "right") %>%
  huxtable::set_bold(row = 1, col = everywhere) %>%
  huxtable::set_bottom_border(row = 1, col = everywhere)  %>%
  huxtable::set_tabular_environment(., "longtable") %>%
  huxtable::set_caption("Generalized raked vote switching counts: Switches between government party (Labour), opposition parties (Conservatives, Liberals, Others), and non-voters in the 2010 UK General Election.") %>%
  huxtable::set_caption_pos(value = "bottomcenter") %>%
  huxtable::set_label("recoded-switches-2")
```

`voteswitchR::recode_switches()` implements this data-processing step as follows:

```{r recoded-switches-1, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model_data <- data_file$raked_switches_imp[[1]] %>%
  voteswitchR::recode_switches(
    mappings = voteswitchR::mappings %>%
      dplyr::mutate(
        gov = case_when(
          outgoing_cabinet_party_lag == 1 ~ "government",
          TRUE ~ "opposition"
        )
      ),
    switch_factor = "gov",
    type = "elections",
    assign_others = "opposition"
    )
```

The argument `mappings` accepts a copy of the mapping file,
`voteswitchR::mappings`, in which we here generate a categorical variable
called `gov` that assigns each party in the mapping file to one of two
categories: government or opposition.
The argument `switch_factor` then specifies that this variable will be used for the
construction of the generalized voter transition matrix. In this step,
the three categories of `gov` are supplemented by codes for residual other
parties that are not included in the mapping file and for non-voters.
By using the argument `assign_others = "opposition"`, users can specify
that the former are subsumed under the category "opposition" and not
assigned a distinct "others" category.
Note that by changing the argument `type` from `elections` to `party-elections`,
users can determine whether they want to obtain election-specific or
party-specific voter transition matrices.
An optional `subgroup` argument (not used here) allows users to specify
that subgroup-specific "raw" voter transition matrices generated via
`voteswitchR::aggregate_switches()` are processed into subgroup-specific
generalized voter transition matrices.

`voteswitchR::recode_switches()` returns a list of three objects required
for estimation and post-estimation:

- `data`: Model data, including a separate column for each cell-specific
switching pattern of the generalized voter transition matrix ("wide format").
- `y_names`: The column names of the outcome variable, i.e., the $C^2$ cells
of the voter transition matrix.
- `y_structure`: A list of data frames that specifies, for each marginal
category of the voter transition matrix, the conceptual meaning for each
cell. An example for government parties, stored under
`model_data$y_structure$government` in the table.
From the perspective of government parties, cell #1, which records
the switching pattern `government_government`, constitutes a retention cell.
Cells #2 and #3 (`government_non`, `government_opposition`) are
loss cells. Conversely, cells #4 and #7 (`non_government`,
`opposition_government`) are gain cells.
All other switching patterns do not involve government partners and are
thus neither gain, loss, nor retention cells.
Analogous information is included for the other two categories under
`model_data$y_structure$opposition` and
`model_data$y_structure$non`, respectively.

```{r government, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
model_data$y_structure$government %>%
  huxtable::as_huxtable(.) %>%
  huxtable::set_width(., 0.8) %>%
  huxtable::set_all_padding(4) %>%
  huxtable::set_font_size(9) %>%
  huxtable::set_background_color(., evens, everywhere, "grey95") %>%
  huxtable::set_col_width(col = c(1:5), value = c(.2, .4, .1, .2, .1)) %>%
  huxtable::set_align(col = 5, value = "right") %>%#
  huxtable::set_bold(row = 1, col = everywhere) %>%
  huxtable::set_bottom_border(row = 1, col = everywhere)  %>%
  huxtable::set_tabular_environment(., "longtable") %>%
  huxtable::set_caption("Conceptual meaning of each cell for governing parties.") %>%
  huxtable::set_caption_pos(value = "bottomcenter") %>%
  huxtable::set_label("government")
```

### Quality checks

Despite its elaborate data-processing routine, `voteswitchR`'s toolbox does not
offer a no panacea for turning a bad survey data set into a good one. To
inspect how strongly survey data deviate from true election results,
`voteswitchR` provides the `calculate_meas_error()` function. This function
allows users to compute party-election-specific directional errors and
election-level mean absolute errors or root mean squared errors, using either
nominal parties or a user-supplied comparative scheme to define the marginal
categories of voter transition matrices. These metrics allow users to assess the
quality of the underlying survey data.
While by no means a perfect measure, it is the best available -- and
the only objective -- criterion for assessing the accuracy of (unraked)
survey-based transition matrices in terms of their marginal vote proportions.
These can then guide users in their decisions on context inclusion and robustness
checks.

```{r measerror, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
meas_error <- calculate_meas_error(
  switches = data_file$switches,
  mappings = voteswitchR::mappings %>%
      dplyr::mutate(
        gov = case_when(
          outgoing_cabinet_party_lag == 1 ~ "government",
          TRUE ~ "opposition"
        )
      ),
  switch_factor = "gov",
  type = "mae"
)
```

The function returns summaries that showcase the deviations of (unraked)
vote proportions from true vote shares at both $t-1$ and $t$.
This information is available for each cell of the election-specific
voter transition matrix and for elections at large, as illustrated below:

```{r measerror-elec, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
meas_error$elec_errors %>%
  dplyr::mutate_if(is.numeric, ~round(., 3)) %>%
  head(8)
```

## Data analysis

`voteswitchR::run_mavcl()` offers an implementation of the MAVCL
model introduced in the main text. Estimation relies on full Bayesian
inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling via `rstan` [@Stan219b].
The first two arguments to the function specify the input data
generated via `voteswitchR::recode_switches()` in the previous step.

`voteswitchR::run_mavcl()` enforces an $x$-centered or "effects-of-causes"
perspective on statistical inference. Therefore, users must choose
*one* variable of primary theoretical interest -- a `main_predictor` --
whose effect on vote switching they seek to study.
If users expect effect moderation, they can specify a `moderator` that
interacts with the `main_predictor`.
Users should explicitly state whether the `main_predictor` and the `moderator`
should be treated as numeric/continuous variables or as categorical/discrete
variables per the arguments `predictor_continuous` and,
optionally, `moderator_continuous`.
So-called control variables can be supplied as a character vector to the argument
`other_covariates`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
mavcl_est <- voteswitchR::run_mavcl(
  data = model_data$data,
  y_names = model_data$y_names,
  main_predictor = "forced.mp.dist.rile_logit",
  predictor_continuous = TRUE,
  moderator = NULL,
  other_covariates = "iso2c",
  iter = 3000L,
  warmup = 2000L,
  thin = 2L,
  chains = 2L,
  cores = 2L,
  seed = 20211011L
) 
```

Next to these main arguments, `voteswitchR::run_mavcl()` accepts the
following arguments for **model specification**:

- Null model:
    - `null_model`: Logical; if `TRUE`, the function runs a null model without any right-hand side variables.
- Random effects specifications:
    - By default, the MAVCL model features cell-specific random intercepts for each voter transition matrix.
    - `re_elections`: Optional: Cell-specific random intercepts for electoral contexts. Should only be used for analyses of party electorates to account for the clustering of multiple parties per electoral context.
    - `re_parties`: Optional: Cell-specific random intercepts for parties. Should only be used for analyses of party electorates to account for the repeated inclusion of identical parties over multiple electoral contexts.
    - `re_countries`: Optional: Cell-specific random intercepts for countries. Can be used to account for the clustering of multiple electoral contexts in the same country.
    - `random_slopes`: Logical; if `TRUE`, the slopes for the main predictor are allowed to vary by cell.
    
Additionally, users can pass various arguments to `voteswitchR::run_mavcl()` for **model estimation**. These are passed on to `rstan`, which `voteswitchR::run_mavcl()` interfaces for fully Bayesian inference. For details, see `?rstan::stan` and `?rstan::sampling`.

One particularity of `voteswitchR::run_mavcl()` that moves beyond `rstan`'s arguments for estimation and computation is the `parallelize` argument, which allows users to parallelize the model estimation *across* imputations. When a list of multiple imputed data sets is passed to `data`, the default setting, `parallelize = FALSE`, allows users to parallelize *within* imputations. This can be accomplished using `rstan`'s `cores` argument, which is then passed on to `rstan::sampling`. For instance, with $M=5$ imputations, the combinations of the arguments `chains = 3`, `cores = 3`, and `parallelize = FALSE` parallelizes the model estimation across three Markov Chains/CPUs *within* the first imputed data set, and then sequentially through the second, third, fourth, and fifth.
Conversely, the combinations of the arguments `chains = 3`, `cores = 3`, and `parallelize = TRUE` parallelizes the model estimation across $5 \times3$ Markov Chains/CPUs by parallelizing the HMC sampler *within* each imputation and parallelizing the imputation-specific samplers *across* imputations. Note that this operation would require a minimum of 15 CPUs. This requirement can be easily met when using remote computing services but typically exceeds the resources of customary desktop computers.
It is also possible, of course, to parallelize estimation across imputations but to estimate the chains within each imputation sequentially. With $M=5$ imputations, the combination of the arguments `chains = 3`, `cores = 1`, and `parallelize = TRUE`, for instance, would spawn five parallelized processes, running three separate Markov chains across each imputation one after another.

## Post-estimation

### Default estimands {-}

After using `voteswitchR::run_mavcl()` to produce a MAVCL estimation object, users can call `voteswitchR::compute_qoi()` to obtain posterior samples of two types of estimands that capture the relationship between the `main_predictor` and various outcomes of interest. 

These default outcomes of interest, $Y$, include:

1. Overall quantities of interest (for each category of the generalized transition matrix):
    - Overall gains
    - Overall losses
    - Overall trade balances
    - Overall trade volumes
    - Retention rate
1. Dyadic quantities of interest (for each pair of categories of the generalized transition matrix):
    - Dyadic gains
    - Dyadic losses
    - Dyadic trade balances
    - Dyadic trade volumes

For each of these outcomes, `voteswitchR:compute_qoi()` returns estimates of the following two quantities that capture the relationship between the respective outcomes, $Y$, and the `main_predictor`, $X$:

1. `conditional_expectation`: Expected values of the outcome quantity $Y$ as a function of a value range $\vec{x}$ of the `main_predictor` $X$ while keeping other covariates $Z$ constant at their observed values, $\mathbb{E}\left[\mathbb{E}[Y_i|X = \vec{x}, Z = Z_i]\right]$
1. `average_marginal_effect`:
    - Average marginal effects, $\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\mathbb{E}[Y_i|X = x_i + \Delta_x, Z = Z_i] - \mathbb{E}[Y_i|X = x_i, Z = Z_i]}{\Delta_x}\right]$ (used when `predictor_continuous = TRUE`)
    - Average first differences, $\mathbb{E}\left[\mathbb{E}[Y_i|X = x_1, Z = Z_i] - \mathbb{E}[Y_i|X = x_2, Z = Z_i]\right]$ (used when `predictor_continuous = FALSE`)

If users specified a `moderator` in the corresponding argument to `voteswitchR::run_mavcl()`, `voteswitchR::compute_qoi()` will automatically compute the expected values and average marginal effects/first differences of the `main_predictor` conditional on specific values of the moderator. In case of categorical moderators, these will simply be the discrete values that identify the unique levels of the moderator. In case of continuous moderators, these will be a value sequence from the sample minimum to the sample maximum of the moderator. The length of this value sequence (which determines whether the gradations should be rather fine or coarse) can be specified via the argument `len_continuous_sequence`.

### Using `voteswitchR::compute_qoi()` {-}

`voteswitchR::compute_qoi()` takes two primary arguments.
`mavcl_object` is the estimation object generated via `voteswitchR::run_mavcl()`.
`y_structure` is a data frame that specifies the conceptual meaning for each
cell for *one* specific category of the generalized voter transition matrix.
Thus, with
the code shown below using `y_structure = model_data$y_structure$government`,
users obtain estimates of the expected values and marginal effects
for the monadic and dyadic outcomes for *government parties* (i.e.,
government parties' overall gains, losses, volumes, and balances as well as
their retention rate plus their dyadic gains, losses, volumes, and balances
with each opposition parties and non-voters).
Analogous quantities can be requested for opposition parties and
non-voters by using `y_structure = model_data$y_structure$opposition` and
`y_structure = model_data$y_structure$non`, respectively.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mavcl_qoi_gov <- voteswitchR::compute_qoi(
  mavcl_object = mavcl_est,
  y_structure = model_data$y_structure$government,
  full_posterior = FALSE,
  posterior_quantiles = c(.5, .025, .975),
  len_continuous_sequence = 21L,
  conditional_expectation = TRUE,
  average_marginal_effect = TRUE,
  ame_shift = "tiny",
  atmeans = FALSE,
  re_null = FALSE,
  relative = FALSE,
  base = NULL
)
```

**Inferential uncertainy**

Inferential uncertainty can be requested in one of two forms: Users can either request the full posterior samples or quantile summaries thereof. To request the former, users can simply set the argument `full_posterior = TRUE`; to request the latter, users should set `full_posterior = FALSE` and specify the desired values for the quantile summary as a vector for the argument `posterior_quantiles`. For instance, `posterior_quantiles = c(.5, .025, .975)` returns posterior medians (50th percentile) along with the 95% credible interval (2.5 and 97.5 percentiles).

**Additional arguments**

- `ame_shift`: Users can determine the size of the counterfactual shift in the main predictor, $\Delta_x$, for the calculation of average marginal effects. The default value, `ame_shift = "tiny"`, takes the standard deviation of a continuous `main_predictor` divided by 1000 to approximate the average marginal effect of an infinitesimal change in $X$. Alternatively, users can pass any numeric value. `ame_shift = 1`, for instance, prompts the calculation of the average marginal effects of a unit change in $X$.
- `relative` and `base`: By setting `relative = TRUE`, users can request all relative as opposed to absolute quantities of interest relative to the predicted size of parties or, more generally, the categories of a generalized voter transition matrix. For this, all absolute quantities will be normalized by `base`. `base = "tm1"` uses parties'/categories' predicted size at $t-1$ for normalization, `base = "t"` uses the predicted size at $t$, and `base = "avg"` uses the average for the two.
- `re_null`: If `TRUE`, the calculation of the quantities of interest only uses the "fixed" portion of the hierarchical model, i.e., the systematic component excluding any random effects.
- `atmeans`: If `TRUE`, users obtain the conditional expected values/marginal effects/first differences for the average observation. This requires `re_null = TRUE`. If `FALSE` (the default), these quantities will first be calculated for each observation and subsequently averaged across the sample. For details on the difference between both approaches, see @Hanmer2013.

## Package data

The package comes with three data frames:

1. `mappings`: Mappings of vote choices from surveys to ParlGov and MARPOR IDs
1. `codebook`: Documentations of mappings
1. `data_guide`: Versions, download links, and access details for survey data
